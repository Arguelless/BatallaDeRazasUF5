# PROJECT GOALS

# The main goal of this project was to develop a very basic turn based fight game in Java.
# To do so we had to, apart from coding, implement a local MYSQL database to store certain data
# about the game. After developing the game, we wrote both a User guide for the game and a 
# technical report. Also we were asked to make 2 diagrams to represent the game's functionalities
# and to export one of the databse tables to an xml file, and then generate an html file to make
# a web with.

# M01

# This module folder contains both the User Guide and the Technical report

# M02

# This module folder contains the necessary sql files to create and import the database and its data,
# although this files are also contained inside the game zip file

# M03

# M04

# This module folder contains the necessary files to create the website using database exported xml file

# M05

# This module folder contains the two diagrams
